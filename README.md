## Abstract
The goal of the [experiment](report.pdf) is to measure the lifetime of cosmic ray muons. To achieve this, a detector consisting of three scintillator planes equipped with photomultiplier tubes and an iron block capable of stopping muons was used. The lifetime was estimated by acquiring two samples of data using two different configurations: one with the iron block between the last two scintillators and one without it. In particular, the muon lifetime estimated from the first dataset is $\tau_{0,1}= (2.104\pm0.060) \text{ }\mu\text{s}$ while, from the combination of the two different sets of data, the lifetime of muons stopping in iron and emitting an upward electron - representing the 68.5\% of the total upgoing events - is estimated to be $\tau_{0,2} = (2.09\pm0.16) \text{ }\mu\text{s}$. Estimates of the muon capture rate in iron were also obtained, yielding $\tau_{c,1} = (0.343\pm0.044) \text{ }\mu\text{s}$ and $\tau_{c,2} = (0.231\pm0.097) \text{ }\mu\text{s}$. While the muon lifetime $\tau_{0,1}$ and the capture rate $\tau_{c,1}$ obtained from the first dataset are not compatible with the expected theoretical values, the estimates from the second dataset, $\tau_{0,2}$ and $\tau_{c,2}$, show compatibility within uncertainties.
